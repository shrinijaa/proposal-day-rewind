      <h2>My Dearest Yevandi,</h2>
      <p>
        Two years ago, on a day filled with butterflies and hope, I looked into your eyes and told you what my heart had been whispering all along. On August 20th, 2023, I proposed to you — not just as a girlfriend, but as someone who saw her whole world in you.
      </p>
      <p>
        And just four days later, on August 24th, you gave me the most magical gift of all — your love. You said, "I love you," and from that moment, everything changed. I became someone’s most favorite person. Someone’s safe place. Someone’s forever.
      </p>
      <p>
        You’ve loved me with a kind of gentleness this world rarely knows. You’ve held my tears, made me laugh until I couldn’t breathe, and loved me even on the days I forgot to love myself. You made me believe that fairy tales are real.
      </p>
      <p>
        This little rewind is a tribute to our beautiful beginning — the way we blossomed like a Ghibli love story. I hope this brings a smile to your face and tears to your eyes — the good kind. Because you are my once-in-a-lifetime.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would never fall in love again... until I found you.
      </p>
      <p class="sign-off">
        Forever yours,<br />
